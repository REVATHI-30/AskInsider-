<div class="image7"><img src="Helping Hand.jpg"></div>

<p class="text6">If you are a student who has just passed out of high school, you will certainly be confused about your college of choice. The reason behind this confusion is that we have many centralized platforms that give information about colleges, but nothing is close to Insider information. </p>

<p class="text7"> This platform provides you the benefit of interacting with a student who is already crafting experiences in a college that you want to know more about. You schedule a meeting with a person who can answer all your questions about the college. We believe great and clear conversations will make it easy for you to make a great decision. </p>

<p class="text9"> If you are a college student or a teacher then you are in a place where you can help students in taking a good decision by signing up as a mentor. In this way you can attract attention towards your college. </p>

<p class="text10"> You can set up your calendar and share the link or if you don’t prefer calendly, you can provide your e-mail to coordinate the meeting with the students who are interested in your college. </p>

<p class="text11"> Now, it’s your chance to become the helping hand. Sign up! </p>
